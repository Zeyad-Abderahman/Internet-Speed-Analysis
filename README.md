# Internet-Speed-Analysis
📊 A data analysis project exploring global internet speed metrics (download/upload speeds, latency) using Python, Pandas, and Plotly. Includes geospatial visualizations and interactive dashboards.
# 🌐 Internet Speed Analysis Project  

This project analyzes internet speed metrics (download/upload speeds, latency) across regions and countries. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis (EDA), geospatial mapping, and interactive visualizations to compare fixed vs. mobile connection performance.  

## 📌 Key Features  
- **Data Processing**: Loads and cleans datasets (fixed/mobile speed metrics).  
- **Visualizations**: Interactive charts (bar, pie, treemap, scatter plots) using Plotly.  
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visual performance metrics on maps.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares speeds across countries and connection types.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
- **Python** (Pandas, Plotly, Geopandas)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📂 Files  
- `Internet_Speed_Project.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook.  
- `/data`: Directory for datasets (optional; exclude large files via `.gitignore`).  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Internet-Speed-Analysis.git
